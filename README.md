# Laser Invasion
This is a simple remake of the classic arcade game Space Invaders, built using Python and the Tkinter GUI library for my Intro To Programming 1 Coursework. The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, shooting down waves of alien invaders while dodging their attacks. The game features basic animations, score tracking, and increasing difficulty.
