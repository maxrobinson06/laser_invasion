# Laser Invasion
This is a simple remake of the classic arcade game Space Invaders, built using Python and the Tkinter GUI library for my Intro To Programming 1 Coursework. The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, shooting down waves of alien invaders while dodging their attacks. The game features basic animations, score tracking, and increasing difficulty.


üïπÔ∏è Features:

1. Player-controlled spaceship with smooth movement

2. Collision Detection System:

  - Bullet-Enemy Detection: Bullets accurately collide with invaders using bounding box detection.
  
  - Enemy-Player Detection: Enemies detect collision with the player for realistic gameplay and damage mechanics.
  
  - Ensures responsive, fair, and consistent gameplay interactions.
  
3. Score counter and game over screen

4. Retro-inspired visuals

5. Cheats & Power-ups:

  - Large Bullets for easier hits.
  
  - Extra Lives to extend your run.
  
  - Slow Down Enemies for tactical advantage.
  
6. Pause Feature: Take a break anytime with a pause/resume function.

7. Leaderboard: Records high scores so you can challenge yourself (or friends!) to beat them.

8. Save & Exit: Exit the game safely and pick up where you left off.

9. Boss key feature to exit while in a work environment.

10. Players can remap keys of their choice
